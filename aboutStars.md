I'm a Northern California Bay Area resident with free time in the summer months allowing me to explore. 
During the non summer months I am at college on the East Coast where I have less free time.
This website features expeditions of mine and includes pictures of the journey. 
My goal is to learn the night sky, photoediting, improve my understanding of photographies smaller details, and learn about everything wildlife related. 
Ultimately, this website will serve as a tool to document my outings and accumulate my photography.

I am currently using a Cannon EOS Rebel T6 Body with a Canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM.
