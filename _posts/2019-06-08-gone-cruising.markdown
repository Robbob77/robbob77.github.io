Upon the arrival of my Canon EOS Rebel T6 I was eager to find a subject to photograph. Taking advantage of rising temperatures, I cruised some local roads and stumbled upon a gorgeous gophersnake.

Once back on the road it continued its crossing allowing for some neat shots:

It was a decent sized snake

After a short photoshoot, I let it continue on its journey.

Assuming I can find more snakes, expect higher quality pictures to come!
