As mentioned in the previous post, the goal of this trip is to get closer to having seen all the rattlesnakes of California. My progress is seen below:

|Species|Lifer Date|Encounters This Summer|
|---|---|---|
|Red Diamond Rattlesnake|March 29, 2018|2|
|Northern Pacific Rattlesnake|June 4, 2018|3|
|Southern Pacific Rattlesnake|March 27, 2019|0|
|Colorado Desert Sidewinder|May 26, 2020|6|
|Mohave Desert Sidewinder|July 1, 2020|4|
|Panamint Rattlesnake|July 2, 2020|1|
|Northern Mohave Rattlesnake|August 16, 2020|2|
|Southwestern Speckled Rattlesnake|August 18, 2020|3|
|Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake|X|0|
|Great Basin Rattlesnake|X|0|

The goal is to find a Southwestern Speckled and Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake (already checked off a Northern Mohave this trip). If I find both of those this trip then I may take one more jab at finding the Great Basin Rattlesnake this summer. 

With that in mind, below is how the trip has gone thus far.

<div align="center"><h3> August 16 </h3></div>

Escaping the thunderstorms in Northern California, I found myself entering the heatwave of Southern California. Having passed what was most likely a snake (too crowded of a road to stop and check) on the way in, I made sure to check some roads out after checking in. Within a couple moments of driving out of town I saw the familiar shape of a snake crossing the road. Unfortunately, in the time it took me to get the car off the road and get back to the snake another car and passed and hit it. First DOR Mohave Rattlesnake of the trip. A little dejected, I took it as a sign that the conditions were prime (and that this road had too much traffic). Not too much later, I was once again greeted by the sight of a snake crossing the road. This time we were able to get it off the road without issue.

To my surprise it was another mohave rattlesnake! My lifer after having seen two DOR. I was excited, though still a little nervous considering I was still on the heavily trafficked road. The above photo is the only one I managed to get with the head in focus. The one below shows off its pattern and its single rattle or button. Truly a neonate snake.

With a long trip ahead of me, I decided to call it after that luck and get some sleep.

<div align="center"><h3> August 17 </h3></div>

On the second day, the luck continued. Before even arriving at Joshua Tree, I stumbled upon two snakes. The first, a california king snake, is always exciting and actually the first one seen in southern california this summer.

![California Kingsnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/calKinSum20.jpg)

Since the next snake I found is my lifer long-nosed snake (spoiler!) I want to point out a couple characteristics of this kingsnake. First off, look at the back of the kingsnake's head, there is the white tear drop. Second, look down the length of the kingsnake's back. it's white and black pattern is not uniform. Most black bands are diagnol and many do not go all the way across.

Here it is! My long awaited lifer long-nosed snake. I am aware of how common these guys are, but I have been looking forward to my first. I was surprised to see their range goes much higher north than I expected. Surprised I haven't come across one before. Starting it off with a tight macro shot of its head.

![Long-nosed Snake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/lonNosSum201.jpg)

It appears to be a clarus phased long-nosed snake as there seems to be almost no reddish coloration. It wasn't until looking back at these shots of the white blotches on the side that I was able to see the little red that is present. This guy was so active I was unable to see these with my naked eye.

![Long-nosed Snake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/lonNosSum20.jpg)

To continue the distinction with the kingsnake seen only ten minutes before, begin at the head by noticing its lack of tear drop. Second, notice the more uniform banding which goes directly perpendicular to the length of the snake (not diagnol). Lastly, the image above shows the white blotches in the black pattern and the slight red colors present (neither present in kingsnakes).

Now having finally made it into Joshua Tree, the next snake was unfortunately a quite dead mohave rattlesnake. Sticking with the trend, only about fifteen minutes beyond the DOR, a live one was found. I was excited at the opportunity to photograph another one, this one being a bit longer as well.

![Northern Mohave Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/mohRatSum202.jpg)

Crazy how well the pattern and color of the rattlesnake blended in with the road. Was really showing off its slight green colors and its rattle tail. I love how rattlesnakes seem to have that 45 degree head angle where they are just sensing.

Need to work on my lighting in night shots, but I was happy with how those two headshots came out. I love getting tight headshots of rattlesnakes.

The last snake of the night was a Colorado Desert Sidewinder. Nice to see these guys again. This one was definetely a little larger than the ones I had seen before. About a 11 rattle tail hiding on the right side of the photo. This guy was alive with energy and quickly got off the road.

Aside from the heat lightning in the distantce, the only other excitement was encountering two DOR glossy snakes. I am sure more of those will be seen at some point during this trip.

<div align="center"><h3> August 18 </h3></div>

Got out with a plan. First day looking for some Southwestern Speckled Rattlesnakes. Wanted to check out a couple locations and go for a little hike. Started out rather slow. The beginning roads were highly trafficked and the temperatures remained quite high. Hit one road that had no one on it, some high rocky hills on either side and looked quite promising aside from the triple digit temperatures. Kept moving and just like the night before, found the first snake right outside of Joshua Tree. 

![Colorado Desert Sidewinder]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/colSidSum201.jpg)

With no shoulder on the road and cars off in the distance, the snake was quickly moved off the road and the journey continued. Entering Joshua Tree, we scanned the horizon and looked for a good location to hike. Before much traveling we were off the road and walking through the desolate land. Dry and deserted at first look. Over time we began to notice life. We began to recognize the quick movements in the bushes were kangaroo mice, many of the lights reflecting back at us were small insects, and the holes we were stepping over were often occupied by Tarantulas.

![Tarantula]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/tarantula.jpg)

It was a cool find to see the Tarantulas. Before long we began to notice them everywhere. Hanging out by their holes and being quick to retreat inside as we approached. They had a vaariety of colors ranging from light brown to dark brown with black stripes. Very neat!

We followed a wash up to the base of a rocky hill and began our slow scramble up. Carefully peering in every crack and crevice and watching our every step. In a matter of minutes I spotted our target. After stepping over a rock, I saw a small patch of dirt amongst the rocks with a creosote bush nearby. Caught off guard I rushed to pull out my camera and snap a couple shots. 

![Southwestern Speckled Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/speRatSum20.jpg)

Very aware of my presence it retreated to the shelter of the creosote bush.

Coiled up, I got a couple shots before leaving it be.

Crazy luck to find it so fast and have it be a larger one. Speckled rattlesnakes are known for having a variety of colors and patterns as their camoflouge represents the environment around them. This one was a peachy color which obviously represented its terrain. It is fascinating as the Colorado Desert Sidewinders in the area maintain a similar peachy color yet can be distinguished from speckled rattlesnakes by their "horned" eyes, smaller size, and unique locomotive method. On the topic of locomotives, I don't know if it is a pattern of finding panamints and speckleds on the hunt but they seem to have a unique slither. It is almost an inching motion where they apply pressure with one segment of their body and inch the rest forward. Obviously, as my sample size is small I can't comment on if it is situation dependent or species dependent.

On the journey back to the car, nothing was seen aside from some black widows. Content with the night after the successful hike, we began to head out of the park. A brief stop to look at the stars, enjoy the Perseid meteor shower, and watch bats circle the car. Passed a scorpion when we continued the drive, but was not fast enough to stop the car and find it.

About an hour into our drive back, we saw the familiar sight of a rattlesnake in the road. It did not take long to identify it as another speckled rattlesnake. 

![Southwestern Speckled Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/speRatSum203.jpg)

This one did not seem to bothered by our presence. Driving by it scared away a couple mice and I am sure the rattlesnake was annoyed with our presence scaring away its prey.

![Southwestern Speckled Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/speRatSum204.jpg)

It slithered right by us and off the road and continued its hunt as seen below. I apologize about the profanity.

There may be some more experimental videos later on. Just checking out some different media forms. 

As the night continued, the luck kept coming. One more speckled before we left the park.

![Southwestern Speckled Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/rattlesnakes/speRatSum205.jpg)

This one was smaller than the other two, but sported a little meal bump. I think its meal bump made it a little lethargic and more defensive. It is the only rattlesnake I have seen this trip that actually coiled up into a defensive position and rattled.

Huge day! I expected the search for the Speckled Rattlesnake to take much longer so rounding this hump is monumental. I'll be looking for the Western Diamondback over the next couple days and seeing if I can maybe come up on another variant of a Speckled.
