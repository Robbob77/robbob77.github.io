As mentioned in the previous post, the goal of this trip is to get closer to having seen all the rattlesnakes of California. My progress is seen below:

|Species|Lifer Date|Encounters This Summer|
|---|---|---|
|Red Diamond Rattlesnake|March 29, 2018|2|
|Northern Pacific Rattlesnake|June 4, 2018|3|
|Southern Pacific Rattlesnake|March 27, 2019|0|
|Colorado Desert Sidewinder|May 26, 2020|5|
|Mohave Desert Sidewinder|July 1, 2020|4|
|Panamint Rattlesnake|July 2, 2020|1|
|Northern Mohave Rattlesnake|August 16, 2020|2|
|Southwestern Speckled Rattlesnake|X|0|
|Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake|X|0|
|Great Basin Rattlesnake|X|0|

The goal is to find a Southwestern Speckled and Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake (already checked off a Northern Mohave this trip). If I find both of those this trip then I may take one more jab at finding the Great Basin Rattlesnake this summer. 

With that in mind, below is how the trip has gone thus far.

Escaping the thunderstorms in Northern California, I found myself entering the heatwave of Southern California. Having passed what was most likely a snake (too crowded of a road to stop and check) on the way in, I made sure to check some roads out after checking in. Within a couple moments of driving out of town I saw the familiar shape of a snake crossing the road. Unfortunately, in the time it took me to get the car off the road and get back to the snake another car and passed and hit it. First DOR Mohave Rattlesnake of the trip. A little dejected, I took it as a sign that the conditions were prime (and that this road had too much traffic). Not too much later, I was once again greeted by the sight of a snake crossing the road. This time we were able to get it off the road without issue.

To my surprise it was another mohave rattlesnake! My lifer after having seen two DOR. I was excited, though still a little nervous considering I was still on the heavily trafficked road. The above photo is the only one I managed to get with the head in focus. The one below shows off its pattern and its single rattle or button. Truly a neonate snake.

With a long trip ahead of me, I decided to call it after that luck and get some sleep.

On the second day, the luck continued. Before even arriving at Joshua Tree, I stumbled upon two snakes. The first, a california king snake, is always exciting and actually the first one seen in southern california this summer.

Since the next snake I found is my lifer long-nosed snake (spoiler!) I want to point out a couple characteristics of this kingsnake. First off, look at the back of the kingsnake's head, there is the white tear drop. Second, look down the length of the kingsnake's back. it's white and black pattern is not uniform. Most black bands are diagnol and many do not go all the way across.

Here it is! My long awaited lifer long-nosed snake. I am aware of how common these guys are, but I have been looking forward to my first. I was surprised to see their range goes much higher north than I expected. Surprised I haven't come across one before. Starting it off with a tight macro shot of its head.

It appears to be a clarus phased long-nosed snake as there seems to be almost no reddish coloration. It wasn't until looking back at these shots of the white blotches on the side that I was able to see the little red that is present. This guy was so active I was unable to see these with my naked eye.

To continue the distinction with the kingsnake seen only ten minutes before, begin at the head by noticing its lack of tear drop. Second, notice the more uniform banding which goes directly perpendicular to the length of the snake (not diagnol). Lastly, the image above shows the white blotches in the black pattern and the slight red colors present (neither present in kingsnakes).

Now having finally made it into Joshua Tree, the next snake was unfortunately a quite dead mohave rattlesnake. Sticking with the trend, only about fifteen minutes beyond the DOR, a live one was found. I was excited at the opportunity to photograph another one, this one being a bit longer as well.

Crazy how well the pattern and color of the rattlesnake blended in with the road. Was really showing off its slight green colors and its rattle tail. I love how rattlesnakes seem to have that 45 degree head angle where they are just sensing.

Need to work on my lighting in night shots, but I was happy with how those two headshots came out. I love getting tight headshots of rattlesnakes.

The last snake of the night was a Colorado Desert Sidewinder. Nice to see these guys again. This one was definetely a little larger than the ones I had seen before. About a 11 rattle tail hiding on the right side of the photo. This guy was alive with energy and quickly got off the road.

Aside from the heat lightning in the distantce, the only other excitement was encountering two DOR glossy snakes. I am sure more of those will be seen at some point during this trip.
