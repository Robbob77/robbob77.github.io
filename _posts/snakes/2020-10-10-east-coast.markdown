On what may very well be the last warm day of fall, I was finally able to find some free time and get out. Checked some spots I had went to in the past. One den produced a milksnake that I am certain was the same one found April of 2018. Went to another more moist location in the chances of maybe stumbling upon a smooth green. Came across some rubble that produced a nice young eastern garter. Walking the road back to the car, I came across a De Kay's Brown snake. Second one I have ever seen. Fun to see this small snake again.

An out of focus picture as it threatenly opens its mouth. Shows its true colors as there was no flash used in this photo.
