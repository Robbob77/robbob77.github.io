So it begins, the first herping outing of the new year. Won't be in California but instead I'm embarking on a drive down the east coast which will result in 19 days in South Central Georgia. There the main goal of the trip will be to try and find tiger, mole, and marbled salamanders, an eastern indigo,  pine snake, canebreaks, and eastern diamondbacks. Those are what I would be most excited about finding though I am sure that most of those are unrealistic at this time of year or at the very least incredibly ambitious. At the very least since I haven't been to Georgia before I am expecting to find a plethora of lifers. 

<div align="center"><h3> January 29 (Day 1)</h3></div>

The trip begins. Having spent the first day getting to North Carolina, we spent our time searching for salamanders. As the Carolina Sand Hill Salamanders had just been diverged from the southern two-lined species, we had those and mud salamanders as our primary goal. We were rewarded early on with a gravid female sand hill.

Apparently other locales contain sand hills with a more orange coloration and spots which make it more closely resemble a mud salamander, but I was still excited to have seen them at all. The second one spotted was a male.

Males have a sort of whisker above their mouth which resembles a moustache and detects pheromones.

We would see two more during the day but neither were photographed. The next species seen was a pair of southern dusky salamanders. I attempted to photograph a particular fiesty sub-adult and got no great identifying pictures but this is the best I got which highlights the red on top and speckles along the side. Later we saw an adult, but it was quickly returned to its habitat without takign the time to photograph the individual.

A change in habitat led us to our one and only mud salamander of the day. It was a sub-adult and had poor colors lacking the traditional bright orange, but retained spots along its body and was quite pretty in the light.

With both our targets in the bag, we went to try our luck dip netting. I a nearby stream we managed to happen upon another salamander species. This one was a broken striped newt. In its adult amphibious stage, it was quite dark and had an aquatic, flat tail. Their name is derived from the fact that their back contains two rows of spots going the length of its body which appears to be a broken stripe.

That being said, its underside was a bright white with dots along the length.

Successful day 1! Both targets hit and four lifer salamanders.

<div align="center"><h3> January 30 (Day 2)</h3></div>

With temperatures starting off cool and rising to the low 60s, we thought it would be a great day to test our luck and look for an indigo. We quickly became familiar with the sandy, pine habitat which had plenty of gopher tortoise burrows spread throughout. Surprisingly, my first snake of the new year, and the only one of the day, happened to be an eastern hognose! Not the snake I expected to find, but one that I have been thinking about for a while. This one appeared to be young and a melanistic black individual. Here it is in-situ.

![Eastern Hognose Snake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day2(1-30)/easHogWin21.jpg)

Although, we intended to pick it up gently and see its full pattern, it ended up putting on its theatrics. Unfortunately, this included plenty of poop, a healthy dose of musk, and a freshly eaten, partially digested toad. Then it lay tongue out and still after its fit of spasms came to an end. 

![Eastern Hognose Snake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day2(1-30)/easHogWin211.jpg)

With a watchful eye on us, it remained only a quarter turned back over and we let it win this battle. It was returned to where we found it to let it flip back over in peace.

The rest of the day was quite the bust though we did stumble upon a slimy salamander. 

![Ocmulgee Slimy Salamander]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day2(1-30)/sliSalWin21.jpg)

Based on the locale we found it in, we identified it as an ocmulgee slimy salamander although there are 8 subspecies in Georgia and they are known to hybridize. The spots and grey coloration on this adult was beautiful. 

![Ocmulgee Slimy Salamander]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day2(1-30)/sliSalWin211.jpg)

Although less than we expected, all around not a bad day when you see two species you haven't seen before. We are still early in this trip and I expect great things to come.

<div align="center"><h3> January 31 (Day 3)</h3></div>

On this warm, rainy day we got some much needed rest and slept in. Come the afternoon, a little break in the rain brought us out to flip some tin. Yielded us a pair of five-lined skinks and a massive broad-headed skink before the rain came pouring in. 

Moving locations, the search went towards amphibians. There was hope that we would stumble upon any of the ambystoma (mole salamanders) which reside in the area, but our main focus was on frogs. We found spring peepers, leopard frogs, bullfrogs, cricket frogs, spade toads, southern toads, and ornate chorus frogs. My favorite were the ornate chorus frogs which we happened upon a pair, one tan and the other green. Unfortunately, the secretive gopher frog eluded us.

The excitement of the night came while wading shin deep through a swamp. With a chorus of frog calls coming from every direction, I noticed a large mass of scales off to my left. Called over my friend and began attempting to identify it. Brown coloration, black tail, and brown mark going from its eye to the jaw. By that point, it became obvious that we had a cottonmouth swimming alongside us!

![Eastern Cottonmouth]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day3(1-31)/easCotWin21.jpg)

On dryer land it coiled up and posed quite nicely for us but refused to show off its white mouth.

A tighter shot showing off its pit and the mark across the eye.

As it seemed to be nearly four feet in length, it appeared to be an older individual. There was also a surprising amount of black on top obscuring the pattern. That could be indicative of old age or hybridization with southern population. A nice picture of its keeled black scales.

Lastly, my best attempt at a macro headshot. Glad to have finally seen another cottonmouth after not being able to photograph my lifer one and a half years ago. With that, we followed the cottonmouth back into the swamp and continued our search for frogs.

<div align="center"><h3> February 3 (Day 6)</h3></div>

The first of February was a catch up day full of work and rest. Back at it on the second of february at which point all day was spet hiking for indigos to no avail. Unfortunately, the first skunk of the trip. 

That brings us to the present day, the weather is a little warmer than the day before and the wind is down nearly 20 mph which hopefully means that the stiller air will allow the warmer temperatures to heat up the ground. With that in mind, another day was spent searching sandy pines hoping for the elusive indigo. Another day without a snake, but I did flip a little fence lizard!

![Eastern Fence Lizard]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day6(2-3)/easFenWin21.jpg)

Awesome to see the turquoise as opposed to the blue underside of western fence lizards. It was also funny to see how much more comfortable the little guy was when it had something to clutch on to.

After the sun was set we went to the run off of a lake to dip net a bit. To my amazement we found some salamanders. Not just any salamanders but sirens! To my understanding these are lesser sirens, but I can't personally rule out the possibility that they may be younger greater sirens. Sirens are salamanders that live in the mud which means their eyes are largly vestigial. Their head is shaped in a way which allows them to get through the mud and burrow with ease. They don't have hind legs but instead have two tiny front legs with four toes that are used to crawl across the ground. Their big paddle tails propel them through the mud and water. My favorite feature are their large tree-like red external gills.

The first one was gorgeous!

The second one was still surprising!

And then they were four! The fourth one was the largest.

Exciting end to the night! Heres some footage of them walking.

More adventures to come! Hopefully as the weather turns warmer the snakes will come out.

<div align="center"><h3> February 7 (Day 10)</h3></div>

After a week of poor weather and abysmal luck spent hiking for indigos and cruising for amphibians it was tough to roll out of bed this morning. Sike! It's always exciting to spend a day outdoors even if you don't find any herps. In the past four days I have seen a bobcat, barred owl, and armadillo. As well as less exotic things including tons of possums, deer, rabbits, and scorpions. That being said, we were back on the board with a snake today!

![Corn Snake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day10(2-7)/corSnaWin21.jpg)

A juvenile corn snake! A welcome sight to see and such a clean one at that. The red and orange coloration around the face was incredible. It also faded out to a cool grey as it approached the tail. 

![Corn Snake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day10(2-7)/corSnaWin211.jpg)

The orange spots above the head trended towards bands as the body widened.

![Corn Snake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day10(2-7)/corSnaWin212.jpg)

Being a juvenile it had huge bug eyes which was really cute to see in this yearling.

One final photo showing off its smooth scales, gorgeous colors, and tiny size.

<div align="center"><h3> February 9 (Day 12)</h3></div>

After claps of thunder that shook my airbnb and the wrath of a heavy downpour it was time to take advantage of the first day of warm weather (ignoring yesterday when my buddy found not one but two indigos while I was stuck in class). In Georgia there is no shortage of tin to flip. Just need to make sure you don't get killed for trying to flip it. With more spots than can be flipped in a day, or possibly in the remainder of our time in Georgia, we embarked to try out some that had not been tested yet. 

The first spot seemed promising with plenty of tin in prime positions. It was only the fourth or so piece of tin that yielded our first snake! A gorgeous corn! This adult was quite healthy and easily above three feet in length. It was awesome to see this individual after seeing the juvenile the other day. It was quite patient with us and posed nicely.

![Corn Snake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day12(2-9)/corSnaWin21.jpg)

In front of the dilapidated barn where it was flipped. 

![Corn Snake Tin Site]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day12(2-9)/tinSite.jpg)

Sites like that are all over Georgia which makes me thinks snakes are everywhere. No wonder there is such an abundance and diversity here. After that we moved further down the road to our second spot of the day. This one was more open and had less tin. Seemed to be more trash as we found tires, carpet, and the remains of a long-gone building. Under the first carpet flipped we found our second snake, a lifer, an Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnake!

![Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day12(2-9)/easDiaWin21.jpg)

That is how it was found, in-situ, under the carpet. Poor guy must have been cold. 

![Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day12(2-9)/easDiaWin211.jpg)

This little guy was clean. Colored slightly olive green with some mustard yellow around the diamonds. The colors were much more vibrant than the western diamondbacks though I would attribute that to the more colorful environment. 

![Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day12(2-9)/easDiaWin212.jpg)

Its black eyes were menacing. This little guy was no more than a foot and a half but had the heart to make you think twice. He was very defensive, watching our every move, rattling his button, and even struck once. I think that may have been the first rattlesnake I have seen strike. Which also goes to show how rare that is as I have seen a significant amount. 

![Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day12(2-9)/easDiaWin213.jpg)

No in-situ for the second one, but it was found between some tin in an open field not far from the first. Similar patterns but a bit less vibrant of a yellow. Could have been siblings. 

![Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day12(2-9)/easDiaWin214.jpg)

It flattened itself to the ground to appear bigger and was just as twitchy as the first. It also struck once.

![Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnake]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snakes/georgia/day12(2-9)/easDiaWin215.jpg)

When it wasn't so calm and coiled, it was trying to pretend it was a bigger snake with more strike radius. It would coil just a little behind the head and slowly slither towards us threateningly. Unfortunately, it was just a little guy so it was more cute than scary.

During this trip my photography skills have improved immensly. I am really learning how to take photos with this macro. Expect more of these to come as I continue to improve.
