All good herpers have their own board line. Mine is in progress.

Most herpers also know local areas they can cruise at night. Tonight I was looking for suitable habitat and found some decent roads. Not too travelled and were alive with amphibians even in milder temperatures. Found some more Pacific Tree Frogs as well as California Toads. The toads were everywhere, often pressed flat against the road taking advantage of what little warmth it offered.

The more unfortunate side of the night were the DORs. Saw a large Northern Alligator Lizard and four Pacific Gophersnakes in varying conditions. One gopher I am considering dead because while showing no sign of impact, its head remained limp whilst its tail wrapped itself around my hand. If not trauma, it was much too sluggish to endure the cold night ahead.

With board lines in progress, hikes planned, roads ripe for cruising, and talk of a camera coming expect more content soon!
