Some of herping is luck. Driving home I saw a Scrub Jay hopping around in some dead grass and thought it looked funny. As I slowed down I saw it harassing a juvenile Pacific Gophersnake. Ecstatic by my luck I jumped out of the car and ran over. I managed to scare off the jay and allow the gopher to escape into a hole but couldn't get a picture. 

Later just walking around a Western Fence Lizard got too close letting me catch my first of the summer.

It had a brilliant blue underside as well.
