As I took a short break from herping, it seems as though the snakes were not taking a break from me! The heat of summer was beginning and I was finding snakes out for walks through the neighborhood. I encountered a gophersnake, sharp-tailed snake, and a kingsnake in the course of two weeks. The kingsnake was surprisingly found in my garage. Maybe its a sign that I should have been out herping.

I only happened to have my camera on me for the sharp-tailed snake encounter. These snakes still confuse me as I have only seen two, one in late december and now this one.

Showing off the sharp tail and red lines along the length of its body. This is only the second time I have used my macro lens and it is proving quite useful. Both in bringing out small details and in tight shots, looking forward to further use.

Playing with headshots.
