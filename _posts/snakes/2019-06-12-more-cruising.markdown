Every outing is a chance to learn. A couple nights ago I came to the realization that hot days don't gaurantee snakes at night. When the heat doesn't leave it can still be too hot for snakes to be out. Luckily I did stumble upon one snake. It was a gorgeous California Kingsnake which made the outing worth it. It was roughly 2 feet in length.

Looking at its face (just below the eye), a little red smear may have been remnants of its last meal. Also the grey streak could have been evidence of a struggle, or dirt.

Last night's outing was more successful. The heat of the day faded and I saw the three species which dominant the roads or are at least common; California Kingsnakes, Northern Pacific Rattlesnakes, and Pacific Gophersnakes. The Gophersnake was the first snake of the night and full of energy. It quickly raised its head in an aggressive manner and flattened its head.

However, it quickly beelined for the side of the road.

The excitment of the night came from the first live rattlesnake cruised. It also served as a moment to try out a new lens.

It was a very young snake probably a little over a foot.

Upon closer inspection it had three rattles and a thick belly with something inside it.

As the heat wave is now over I should be out hiking in the near future.
