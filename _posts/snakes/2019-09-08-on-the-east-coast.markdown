One little hike before I am stranded without a car. All it took to get a little taste of the East Coast amphibian scene was to flip a couple rocks and logs. Rocks in the shade were yielding the salamanders. For awhile every rock I flipped had a couple red backed salamanders under them. They were the only salamanders I saw though I did see their red backed and lead backed variations. 

Unfortunately the lead backed variation was out of focus.

My best picture of the outing was of the traditional red backed variety of red backed salamanders.

I was excited to also stumble upon a Red Eft. While the red backs were found mostly under rocks in the shade I found the red eft under a log in the sun. Will be interesting to see if this is a trend that continues.

This was a juvenile as once they reach maturity they turn an olive green color. 

There were also chipmunks all over the place. One let me get close enough to photograph.

As this was one of my first times photographing smaller animals many of the photos did not come out well. I expect that to change over the course of fall as my focus will turn to amphibians. Here are some of those photos.

A couple days before that in another location, was frog central.

Far off I was able to spot a Greater Blue Heron.

As I no longer have access to a car, updates will become sparse.
