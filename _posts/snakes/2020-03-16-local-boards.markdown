Nothing crazy today, just finished off the remainder of my local boards.  Uncovered another ring-neck under one of the first few boards. The colors were possibly even more vibrant on this one.

Funnily enough, it was playing dead in a very symmetrical pattern.

This picture spoke to me.

Only other snake encountered was a gophersnake under the last board. About the same size as the kings found yesterday. Very defensive as it immediately triangulated its head and got in a position to strike.

It did strike a couple times but never landed any.

Scale picture. Also fun to see the coloration diminish on the tail towards a more orange/black pattern.

Overall, good day. Lots of salamanders, more rodents, and a few lizards to accompany the snakes pictured. Need to leave my boards alone for a bit. Hoping to get out hiking and flip some rocks in the next couple days. Lots still to see.
