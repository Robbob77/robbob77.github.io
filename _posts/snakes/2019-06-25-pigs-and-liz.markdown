Today was a bust for snakes. Woke up at sunrise to check boards and then hike and didn't see a single snake. But it wasn't a complete loss. While checking the boards, I found three snake skins which show that the habitat is prime. One was even intact and nearly four and a half feet long. It looked like it may have continued into a hole as well.

On the hike I flipped rocks and checked out a little pond next to some woods. Saw a pair of wild pigs run out onto the trail. One ran off before I could get a picture.

As I continued to explore the pond, I heard some Oinks and rustling in the bushes behind me. Managed to see three piglets who were headed my direction. They saw me and turned around. Two were black and one was white and brown.

Even though I didn't see snakes, there were many lizards amongst the rocks. I'm pretty sure most of them were Western Fence Lizards.

Most likely a dark phase Western Fence Lizard.

I also managed to find two Skilton's Skinks. Only one wanted to be photographed.
