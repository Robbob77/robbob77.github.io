A weekend getaway up near Tahoe allowed for some gorgeous hikes. Working to climb in elevation gave some pretty views over the course of 22 miles of hiking. At no point did it become an all out herping expedition but prime habitat was appreciated and rocks were flipped. I was graced with one snake, the first rubber boa of the summer. 

It was a large one. Nearing the maximum length, I'd like to say it was three feet long. This full body picture shows its length with no scale. You can see the wrinkly skin which give it a rubbery texture. Slightly under its body was its tail which was characteristically scarred. Its head is hiding behind the small plant.

This picture of it in the hands of my companion allow for a little bit of scale. It is nearly as thick as his fingers and quite large.

Finally, some headshots.

The only other reptile we were able to get our hands on was a sagebrush lizard. It was quite large and had recently lost its tail. It was a brilliant dark color with turqouise speckling.
