I lied. There was another part of my normal route that had boards. I'm excited to report that the season is off to a good start. Another day, another handful of snakes. I look forward to what these boards bring as the weather dries up. Hopefully some norpacs move in. 

That being said, the excursion started off with a pair of gophersnakes in neighboring boards. The first one was decent sized and very defensive. Flattening its head and striking.

The second one, I left under the board and just observed. It had clearly been in a scrap recently as it had two wounds on its body.

My calm watching did not startle it. It just looked for new cover.

Wound two. I wonder if it was grabbed by a bird or how these came to be.

Last snake of the day was another ring-neck. I am loving finding these after not finding any last year. I'm still blown away by their colors. However, I'm finding that I need to be more creative with my shots. Hopefully this drive will lead to improved photography skills as I look for unique angles on these guys.

One of the more exciting finds was the tiger salamander. This is the first one I have found not crossing a road.

Apparently I was bugging it quite a bit. After this shot I returned it to its cover and let it be.
