This hobby will keep me in tune with the moon. Learned the hard way that a dark sky often comes from a moonless sky.

The moon was so bright that it looks like daytime, even on low (relatively) shutter speeds.

Practicing more foreground lit objects. Wish there were more stars in the background.

First attempt at pictures through a telescope. Focus is tricky.

The first night was the best in terms of sky darkness. We were a couple days before a full moon, but thankfully the moon set a couple hours before the sun rose giving us a small window to see the milky way.

Image taken a couple days after the previous few. Milky way with the setting moon giving off intense light.

More foreground objects. This time soley illuminated by the full moon.
