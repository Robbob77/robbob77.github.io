Fabre Focus article #1

Talk about seeing it outside, hearing others excitement, observing it, feeling it climb and grasp onto fingers, appreciation of different body parts, it calming down, cleaning legs, watching it breath, brings focus to the belly, notice it is gravid, put it down, see it clawing at the window, let it go, maybe return and observe more?, mention its copulation sometime in the last 11 days

It was a warm September afternoon as I was ripped from my thoughts by the excitment of my suitemate, Simone. Having taken Invertebrate Biology her freshman year she already had a remarkable appreciation for the european mantis whose leaf-like camoflouge did it no justice against the empty white walls of the townhouse. After alerting me of its presence, Simone ran off to her soccer practice. Leaving me with this mantid. Alone with a mantis. Struck by its vivid green coloration, I watched it at first. It watched me. Or at least I think so. With its complex alien (DETAIL) looking eye structure I couldn't tell what it was looking at, but it was definetely aware of my presence. Afraid it may fly off I brought it inside. Nudging it onto my finger, I felt its tactile additions to its front appendages grip onto my finger. Clinging to me, it joined me in my control environment. 

At first there was a stalemate. No movement by either side. I was stationary, plopped on a chair staring intently at my finger. Wondering if it was going to fly away. Clutched to my finger, judging the current threat level, and breathing. With each breath, its plump abdomen expanded. This brought my attention to the grey area present on its abdoment. Stretched out it looked ready to burst. Reminding me of a human's stretch marks my mind instantly went to pregnancy...or gravidness. This means its a female!

Enter paragraph of copulation/egg sack soon?

It seemed as though both sides were calm. With that four small appendages unfurled themself from her mouth and she began to clean her front four appendages, beginning with the middle two. After letting her clean, I set her down on the window sill. Appreciating her calm demeaner I knew she would make a great subject to photograph. Only leaving her for a second, I saw that she began to explore her windowsill. This made for some great candid shots. However, the accidental flash startled her leading to another moment of stillness. Once that subsided, she made off towards the window. As though she were a dog wanting to be let out she began to claw at the window with her front legs. There was a slight audible tap as her legs hit the glass and failed to catch hold, sliding down. Understanding her intentions, I once again nudged her onto my finger. Though she was more reluctant in trusting me this time, I returned her to her perch on the wall of my townhouse.

End with a message about appreciating insects?
