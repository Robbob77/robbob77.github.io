I will begin by saying this site is still 100% focused on herping. That being said, in anticipation of my trip to Death Valley I began to look into star photography. Knowing that I would have the opportunity to shoot under a completely dark sky I decided to jump into the rabbit hole of star photography. With a canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM lens, tripod, and remote added to my photography equipment I began to experiment under my local sky. This is the result.

First things first, gotta find some stars to shoot. Surprised I could see some of the milky way through all the light pollution.

Need to work on composition and lighting of foreground objects.

Trying my hand at a little editing and star trails.

Better with a little foreground.

I am just beginning to learn the night sky and photoediting. Many of my photos on here will be completely unedited, but I hope to change that as I learn to edit. I plan to do an initial preediting dump of photos on a post and then add the edited ones to the same post later as I work through them.
