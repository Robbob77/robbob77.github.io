Intervalometer came in finally. I have been looking forward to creating star timelapeses. Unfortunately, the day it came in was not the best for a timelapse. Regardless, I intended to begin to learn how it worked. Got lucky and saw a pocket of sky.

The following day I was able to take a longer timelapse of an actually clear night sky. I'm learning the importance of finding a dark environment as the routine traffic in my neighborhood really affected the lighting in the foreground. It was cool to see airplanes, satellites, and potentially shooting stars making their way across the frames. The only odd part is the star that appears and disappears while not moving in the top left corner.

I really can't wait to get back under a dark sky so I can timelapse the milky way. Even though the milky way was present, all other directions had light pollution along the horizon. This timelapse was taken about 50ft off the highway and was subject to the headlights from passing cars. It ended when a car pulled off the road, passing me, and over exposing a couple frames. 

I am beginning to understand the effects of frame rate on the end result and can play with that in future time lapses. I need to work with a dynamic amount of light so I can get practice having dynamic settings througout the timelapse.

While there I couldn't help but take a couple shots. These reiterate the idea that stars needs to have something in the foreground in order to bring some perspective and help compose the photo. While the second image is better, the first image is more appealing because of the foreground.
