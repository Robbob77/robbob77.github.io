Before I head down to Southern California for the last time this summer I wanted to try a couple things out. First, my brother got a mount and I wanted to test out my camera on it. Unfortunately, the set up with my camera and telescope was a little too heavy for the setup and the tracking did not work. That being said I got the picture of Jupiter below. It has decent color and there is some appearance of the bands but when zoomed in it is clearly out of focus.

The other thing I wanted to try out was getting a picture of my brother using the telescope in front of the stars. I am very happy with this photo and it is a huge improvement on the original death valley photo of him. Composition. Lighting. Posing. There are a lot of details I focused on that came out pretty well. Looking to take another one in Southern California with the Milky Way in the background.
