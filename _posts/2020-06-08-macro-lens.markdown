Recently got a macro lens and just had to take it out. Checked my boards the morning of a hot day and came across a gophersnake. One snake was all I was looking for as I just needed a target to practice on.

The zoom and amount of detail is amazing. This is the mose detailed picture of scales I have ever gotten. Really shows the keeled scales.

My first in tight headshot. Lots more to come. They are fun to take but require some skill and taking into account a lot of variables.

Turns out this snake was dealing with some issues. It had some healed scratches on its face and some blood stains along its body. However, that eye has issues. Most likely wounded leading to swelling.

The next night found a very clean younger gopher. This lens is going to produce some very nice photos.

Seems like smaller scales show less distinctive keeling. Love the lighting in this photo.

Also cruised a norpac that day but those are not the best models for macro photography. Though the picture did come out quite well taking into account the distance. Will need to experiment some with taking macro photos from further out. Also have a lens shield that I need to experiment with.

Little practice taken a couple nights later on a black widow. Need to really understand lighting when using the lens. Also my focusing skills could use some work.
