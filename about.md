I'm a Northern California Bay Area resident with free time in the summer months allowing me to explore. 
During the non summer months I am at college on the East Coast where my herping expeditions are few and far between.
This website features expeditions of mine and includes pictures of the journey. 
My goal is to become a more experienced herper. A better understanding of optimal snake conditions, will increase encounters and allow more instances to improve my photography.
Ultimately, this website will serve as a tool to document my outings and accumulate my photography.

I am currently using a Cannon EOS Rebel T6 Body with two lenses. A EF-S 19-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II and EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III. I am also looking into macro lenses.
